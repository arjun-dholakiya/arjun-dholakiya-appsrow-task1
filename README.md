## ✅ Task Status

- **Task Assigned:** Task 1 (pelotech ui)
- **Overall Progress:** Completed
- **Desktop Responsiveness:** ✅ 100%
- **Mobile Responsiveness:** ⚠️ ~80%
- **Animations:** ✅ 100% working

## 🛠 Tech Stack Used

- **React** – Component-based UI development
- **Vite** – Fast development server and build tool
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Framer Motion** – Animations and interactive transitions

---

## 🎨 UI & Animation

- Smooth and performant animations implemented using **Framer Motion**
- Interactive elements such as:
  - Task progress UI
  - Step indicators
  - Hover and active states
- All animations are fully functional and consistent across supported screen sizes

---

## 📱 Responsiveness

- Desktop layout closely matches the Figma design (pixel-accurate focus)
- Tablet and mobile responsiveness implemented for most components
- Hero section mobile responsiveness is still under improvement
- No broken layouts or non-functional UI elements

## 🚧 Challenges Faced

While working on this task, I faced a few real-world frontend challenges:

- **Hero Section Responsiveness**  
  The Hero component contains large typography, overlapping elements, and desktop-focused positioning. Making it fully responsive for smaller screens without affecting the desktop layout required multiple iterations. Desktop responsiveness is complete, and mobile optimization is currently in progress.

- **Animation Implementation**  
  Implementing smooth and consistent animations using Framer Motion was challenging, especially when coordinating animations with responsive layouts. Fine-tuning timing, easing, and animation behavior across screen sizes required careful testing.

- **Balancing Pixel Accuracy and Responsiveness**  
  Maintaining pixel-perfect accuracy for desktop while ensuring responsive behavior on mobile devices was challenging for sections using absolute positioning and complex layouts. Desktop accuracy was prioritized as per task requirements, followed by responsive improvements.

These challenges helped improve my understanding of responsive UI design and animation-driven frontend development in real-world scenarios.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Hero section mobile responsiveness is not fully complete
- Minor spacing and alignment adjustments remain for smaller screens

These were intentionally left to ensure **on-time submission**, as encouraged in the task instructions.

## 📌 Submission Notes

- Focused on:
  - Clean and readable code structure
  - Accurate desktop implementation
  - Smooth animations
  - Functional and maintainable components

## 📬 Final Note

This submission reflects my approach to real-world frontend tasks — prioritizing clarity, structure, responsiveness, and meeting deadlines over delaying submission for perfection.

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this assignment.
