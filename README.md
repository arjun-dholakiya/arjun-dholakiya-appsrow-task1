# Frontend Development Task – Task 1

This repository contains my submission for **Task 1** of the Appsrow Front-End Development assignment.  
The objective was to convert the provided Figma homepage design into a functional, responsive, and well-structured frontend implementation while maintaining accuracy and clean code practices.

## ✅ Task Status

- **Task Assigned:** Task 1 (Homepage)
- **Overall Progress:** Completed
- **Desktop Responsiveness:** ✅ 100%
- **Mobile / Tablet Responsiveness:** ⚠️ ~80%
- **Animations:** ✅ 100% working
- **Functionality:** ✅ All interactions working correctly

> Note: Most components are fully responsive. The **Hero section is currently optimized for desktop**, and mobile responsiveness for this section is still in progress.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack Used

- **React** – Component-based UI development
- **Vite** – Fast development server and build tool
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Framer Motion** – Animations and interactive transitions

---

## 🎨 UI & Animation

- Smooth and performant animations implemented using **Framer Motion**
- Interactive elements such as:
  - Task progress UI
  - Step indicators
  - Hover and active states
- All animations are fully functional and consistent across supported screen sizes

---

## 📱 Responsiveness

- Desktop layout closely matches the Figma design (pixel-accurate focus)
- Tablet and mobile responsiveness implemented for most components
- Hero section mobile responsiveness is still under improvement
- No broken layouts or non-functional UI elements

---

## 🤖 AI Usage

The following AI tools were used responsibly during development:

- **ChatGPT** – Assisted with layout logic, debugging, responsiveness strategies, and code refinement
- **Gemini** – Used for cross-checking implementation approaches and validating UI logic
- **Antigravity** – Used for UI inspiration and animation flow ideas

Most of the code was written and implemented manually in **VS Code**.  
AI tools were used only as assistance; all final decisions, structure, and implementation were done by me.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Hero section mobile responsiveness is not fully complete
- Minor spacing and alignment adjustments remain for smaller screens

These were intentionally left to ensure **on-time submission**, as encouraged in the task instructions.

---

## 📌 Submission Notes

- Focused on:
  - Clean and readable code structure
  - Accurate desktop implementation
  - Smooth animations
  - Functional and maintainable components
- Avoided unnecessary creative changes beyond the provided Figma design

---

## 📬 Final Note

This submission reflects my approach to real-world frontend tasks — prioritizing clarity, structure, responsiveness, and meeting deadlines over delaying submission for perfection.

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this assignment.
